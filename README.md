# Assessment 3: Project – Build a Next.js 15 Application Integrated with a Laravel API
## Units

-   **ICTWEB517** – Create web-based programs
-   **ICTPRG546** – Validate application designs against specifications

---

## Assessment Overview

In this assessment, you will develop a **Next.js 15 (App Router)** frontend application integrated with a **provided Laravel Project Management Workspace API**.  
You will demonstrate full **CRUD functionality** for the `projects` and `tasks` routes while using the `users` and `auth` routes (provided by the lecturer) for authentication and user handling.

---

## Assessment Resources

-   Blackboard Cluster – Web Application Development
-   IDE such as **VS Code**
-   **Laravel Project Management Workspace API** (provided by lecturer)
-   **Postman Online API Documentation** (official published documentation)
-   **GitHub Classroom repository** with linting + static deployment workflow
-   **Deployed API instance** available on _Screencraft_ for live endpoint testing **OR**  
    **Working Laravel codebase** for local development
-   **Sample JSON response files** representing example API objects
-   **Database schema diagram**

---

## Assessment Instructions

You are to build a **web-based program** using an object-oriented programming language.  
These tasks will be informed by the provided API and assessment template.

**You must:**

-   Develop the application using the **Next.js 15 App Router** structure.
-   Use **Next.js components** such as `<Link>`, `<Image>`, and standard error components.
-   Build a **mobile-responsive UI/UX** using a chosen **CSS framework** (Tailwind, Bulma, Bootstrap, etc.).
-   Implement full **CRUD operations** for the `projects` and `tasks` API routes.
-   Integrate Laravel API endpoints for:
    -   `users` _(provided by lecturer in class activity)_
    -   `auth` _(provided in assessment resources)_
    -   `projects`
    -   `tasks`
-   Handle **forms** and **routes** with clear validation and error feedback.
-   Submit via **GitHub Classroom** with a passing **GitHub Actions workflow** (linting + static build).
-   Use **small, specific, descriptive Git commits** showing progressive development.
-   Include **screenshots** of CRUD actions, error handling, and workflow results.
-   Provide a **README** describing framework choice, API usage, and deployment.
-   Research application hosting platforms suitable for **React/Next.js** (provide links).
-   Upload your final application to your chosen hosting platform and submit the link via Blackboard.

## Additional Assessment Deliverables

### Your GitHub Classroom repository must include:

-   Small, descriptive commits showing incremental progress
-   Passing GitHub Actions workflow (linting + static deployment)
-   README file detailing CSS framework, structure, and routes used

### You must also provide:

-   Screenshots showing testing of CRUD operations, responsiveness, and errors
-   Evidence of use of **Postman Online Documentation**

## API Documentation Reference

Students will use the **Laravel Project Management Workspace API**, documented online via Postman.  
The documentation provides full endpoint definitions and CRUD requirements.

Additional API resources include:

-   A **deployed API instance** on _Screencraft_
-   A **local Laravel codebase** for development
-   Example **JSON response files** for each resource type
